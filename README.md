## Task 1: Advanced Data Cleaning and Statistical Analysis

**Objective:**  
Analyze a raw dataset (e.g., sales, user behavior, or social media metrics) to extract actionable insights through data cleaning and statistical analysis.

**Key Steps:**
- Import and explore raw datasets using **Pandas** and **NumPy**.
- Handle missing values, duplicates, and data inconsistencies.
- Perform statistical analysis including:
  - Hypothesis testing
  - Correlation analysis
  - Summary statistics
- Generate a clean, structured summary report for integration with backend APIs.

**Libraries Used:**  
`pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`

## Task 2: Automated Data Visualization Pipeline

**Objective:**  
Develop a pipeline to automatically generate interactive visualizations from datasets.

**Key Steps:**
- Use **Plotly** or **Seaborn** to create visualizations such as heatmaps and trend charts.
- Automate data refresh and visualization generation using Python scripts.
- Ensure outputs are exportable for frontend display or Flutter app integration.

**Libraries Used:**  
`pandas`, `plotly`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `schedule`

## Task 3: Predictive Analytics with Reporting

**Objective:**  
Build predictive models to forecast trends and automate reporting.

**Key Steps:**
- Implement time-series forecasting using **ARIMA** or **Prophet**.
- Evaluate model performance with metrics such as **MAE** and **RMSE**.
- Generate detailed reports with visualizations.
- Automate report generation for AI agent workflows and backend access.

**Libraries Used:**  
`pandas`, `prophet`, `statsmodels`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
